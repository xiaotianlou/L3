Welcome to CS1XC3's Lab #3: Branches, Merging and Conflicts! 

The purpose of this lab is to merge all branches together in such a manner that you have a (quasi) functional chess program at the end.  

The board is stored as a 2D array of integers.  The integers have the following interpretations.

0 -> Blank Space
1 -> King
2 -> Queen
3 -> Bishop
4 -> Knight
5 -> Rook
6 -> Pawn
